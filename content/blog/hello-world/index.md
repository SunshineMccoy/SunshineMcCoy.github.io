This is my first blog post on my new website! This site will be a host of my portfolio and blog about learning to code.
I have been following the freeCodeCamp curriculum from [freecodecamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org/ "FreeCodeCamp").
So far, I have finished 5 of the 6 certifications and just have the Information Security And Quality Assurance Certification remaining.

Recently, I have been learning how to make websites using Gatsby, which is a static site generator that uses React as a framework. Using a static 
site generator will ensure that my sites load quickly and are efficient to host, so I will also be using Gatsby for my upcoming freelancing opportunities.
